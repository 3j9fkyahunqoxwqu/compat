# Compatibility Standard

## Abstract

The [Compatibility Standard](https://compat.spec.whatwg.org/) describes a collection of non-standard (and often vendor-prefixed) CSS properties and DOM APIs that web browsers need to support for compatibility with the de-facto web.

## Contribute

This spec is built using [Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed). To get Bikeshed installed locally, head over to the Bikeshed [docs](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/blob/prespec/docs/install.md)

Update `compatibility.bs` with your changes, run `bikeshed` in the working directory to generate `compatibility.html`, and then send a pull request describing your changes.

Contributions are welcome, so long as you agree to the [CC0 license](LICENSE). :rainbow: :stars:
